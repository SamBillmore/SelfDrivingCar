# Code for a basic self driving car algorithm

Fun project to try out image recognition and convoluted neural networks.

### Files included in this repository

*finding_lane_lines.py*
- Contains code for identifying straight lane lines from an image of a road, taken from the perspective of a car.

*Images_and_videos* directory
- Contains the image and video used in the `finding_lane_lines.py` script.

### To run the code

*finding_lane_lines.py*

The script references the image and the video in the folder `Images_and_videos`.

Download the repo to a local folder and navigate to the folder location using the command prompt or terminal. 

Run the python script using `python finding_lane_line.py`.

The first set of images are demonstrating the different stages of the algorithm. Press any key to continue to the next image.

Once the video starts, only the final output of the algorithm is shown. Once the video finishes the program exits. To exit before the video has ended press `q`.
